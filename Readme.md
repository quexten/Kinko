# Resticat - A GTK4 based restic gui

Resticat is a graphical frontend for restic. It supports creating scheduled 
restic backups, and triggering backups on other events (connecting to power, connecting to a *metered*/*unmetered* network).

** Warning ** This is still very early in development, as it was hacked together as a prototype in a weekend. Don't expect to use it yet.
